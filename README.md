# ApplePear
Interactive tool to compare two directories and easily smooth out any differences

## Run

Dependencies:
- Python 3.6+

This tool currently has no runnable main script. Intended usage is by including its modules in a runner script that provides:
- Configuration of dirs to compare and paths to ignore
- Storage of differences that have been marked as ignorable

_TODO: Provide sample script_

## Name background
You know the saying about comparing apples and oranges?
